ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Taylor Wirth, a PhD student at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. 
This github is a repository for projects that I am currently working on, and allows access for all. 
I'm currently focusing my work on:
- Self-Calibrating pH sensors as part of the California automated shore station program: https://sccoos.org/
- BGC-Argo profiling float data analysis
- BGC sensor calibration and improvement

If you have any questions or want to reach out, shoot me an email: twirth@ucsd.edu
